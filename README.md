# Spring 2025 - Midterm 251

This is a take-home exam. 
Submit answers to the questions laid out in the file [index.qmd](index.qmd) by submitting your answers through the Github Classroom repository before the due date given in Canvas.

You are allowed full access to your notes, class materials and other online resources. When you are using an online resource, such as e.g. StackOverflow, make sure to cite them. In case of using any AI tools, submit the prompt, the original answer, and a marked-up version of the differences to your submitted answer in separate files (add to repo and push).

 The assumption for any submitted work is, that it is your work and that therefore you are able to explain any aspect to your answers. 
If you cannot explain the logic behind your solution, you will not receive credit. The result of an oral exam supersedes the grade of any written exam.
